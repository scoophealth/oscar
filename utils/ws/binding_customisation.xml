<!-- 
	WARNING!
	You must make sure all binding customisations in a project are the same.
	i.e. the binding customisation in the caisi integrator project is compiled into org.w3._2001.xmlschema.Adapter1.java in the client stubs.
	the binding customisation in the myoscar project is compiled into org.w3._2001.xmlschema.Adapter1.java in the client stubs.
	Therefore, any project which uses both client stubs, i.e. oscar, must make sure the 2 binding customisations they're getting (integrato & myoscar)
	are identical or else only one will be used and the other set of client stubs may bomb out when it reads the wrong Adapter1.class.
	Therefore, the binding customisations in the Integrator and MyOscar project must be identical.
	
	Note that this is not a restriction on other people. This is only a restriction on our client build script, anyone who wishes to not
	have this binding customisation can just build their own clients from the wsdl's or alter this binding customisation.
