was recently admitted to the Tiesville Caing Hospital for a CHF exacerbation.
During the recent admission , his home Lasix was increased from 20
mg p.o. daily to 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. During the past admission , he

CONSULTANTS:
Hematology of BH , Dr. Bradley Ebanks .
ASSESSMENT:
This is an 88-year-old Co Louis Awestinsde male with a history of
hypertension , diabetes , CHF who presented with increasing
shortness of breath likely secondary to CHF and also presented
with a fever concerning for pneumonia for which he was treated
with antibiotics. The patient also had a new diagnosis of
amyloid during this admission.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Cardiovascular:
A. Ischemia: The patient has no known diagnosis of CAD;
however , he has many risk factors. The patient had a troponin of
0.7 on admit which subsequently trended down. This troponin leak
was thought to be due to demand. The patient remained chest
pain-free during his entire hospital course , and had no acute
ischemic issues. The patient was continued on his aspirin ,
beta-blocker and statin medications.
B. Pump: The patient has a history of CHF with an EF of 40-45%.
In the past , this congestive heart failure had been presumably
attributed to ischemic for hypertensive etiology. However ,
during this admission , the patient had a cardiac biopsy that was
positive for amyloid suggesting that amyloid is the cause
underlying his CHF. The patient appeared mildly fluid overloaded
on admission. He was successfully diuresed with 100 IV Lasix for
several days. The patient has been switched to his home dose of
Lasix of 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. and was euvolemic for several days
prior to his discharge. His euvolemic weight on 8/18/07 was
64.5 kilograms. His discharge weight will be reported in an
addendum. During this admission , he was continued on his
beta-blocker. His calcium channel blocker and diltiazem was
discontinued during this admission given his likely restrictive
heart physiology with his new diagnosis of amyloid. The patient
was started on a nitrate during this admission in order to reduce
preload. As mentioned above , the patient had a catheterization
with an endomyocardial biopsy that was positive for amyloid. A
panel of other amyloid-related tests were also sent out. Of
note , serum genetic amyloid testing was pending at the time of
discharge. Of note , the patient had a serum immunofixation test
that was within normal limits. The patient had a urine
immunofixation test with a positive monoclonal spike with Lambda
light chain. The patient also had a serum-free light chain assay
that was equivocal/positive. The patient also had positive
proteinuria on a spot urine. The patient also had a bone marrow
biopsy done by Dr. Jarred Canner of MOMH in order to further
define this subtype of amyloid that this patient has and in order
to facilitate a screening of his family members for amyloid. He
also had a bone marrow biopsy given the monoclonal spike on his
urine immunofixation test.
C. Rhythm: The patient has a pacemaker originally put in for
sick sinus syndrome. He is V-paced. The patient was discovered
to be in atrial fibrillation on this admission. On 11/0/07 , the
EP Service changed the pacemaker setting to VVI given that the
patient was in atrial fibrillation and decreased the heart rate
to the 60s-70s. The patient remained on telemetry throughout his
stay which was uneventful. The patient was also started on
Coumadin for anticoagulation given his atrial fibrillation and
the diagnosis of amyloid. The patient remained subtherapeutic
and on 3/14/07 , his INR was still subtherapeutic at 1.5 , and he
will most likely be discharged on Coumadin 3.5 mg every evening
which will be adjusted as necessary at the Rehabilitation
Facility.
2. Infectious Disease: The patient presented with a mild cough.
The patient had a fever on admit but was afebrile after one to
two days on antibiotics. The patient had no leukocytosis.
Again , there was a question of pneumonia on the chest x-ray and
his clinical findings were suspicious for pneumonia. The patient
received a five-day course of levofloxacin at 750 mg daily. The
course of antibiotics ended on 3/25/07 .  The patient had blood ,
urine and sputum cultures which were negative.
3. Heme: The patient has baseline anemia between hematocrit of
31 and 32 which remained stable during his hospitalization. The
patient also has a baseline thrombocytopenia with platelets at
approximately 170 which remained stable throughout his
hospitalization and again the patient as stated above was started
on Coumadin during this admission for atrial fibrillation and for
amyloid. The Coumadin was slowly increased up to 3.5 mg given
subtherapeutic INR. The patient had a bone marrow biopsy done on
6/17/07 as mentioned above in order to further define the
amyloid ??_?? and because of the monoclonal spike on the urine
immunofixation. The final results of the bone marrow biopsy are
pending.
4. Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes. At first ,
he was on his home dose of NPH insulin which was 20 units
subcutaneous daily as well as an insulin sliding scale. Because
of persistent hypoglycemia , the patient's NPH was reduced to 10
units of NPH insulin subcutaneous daily.
5. FEN: The patient had a low-salt diet and a 2-liter fluid
restriction and was seen by Nutrition inhouse.
6. Renal: The patient had a creatinine of approximately 1.0
which stayed stable throughout his hospitalization.
7. GI: The patient has chronic LFT abnormalities likely
secondary to CHF; however , the etiology is uncertain.
8. Question restless leg syndrome: On 5/10/07 , the patient was
complaining of myoclonic jerks of his right leg which is an old
problem. His general exam was within normal limits. He was
given a trial of magnesium supplementation inhouse for this.
9. Low back , sacral pain: His low back pain appears to be
chronic and it was treated with oxycodone successfully. The
patient also was noted to have a skin tear on his right buttock
which showed no signs of infection and a DuoDERM was placed over
it for wound care. The patient also had a stage I sacral
decubitus ulcer and a DuoDERM was placed on it for wound care and
for protection.
10. Prophylaxis: The patient was on DVT dose Lovenox inhouse
and was also on Coumadin.
11. Physical Therapy: Of note , the patient has a left BKA. The
patient's family brought in his prosthetic leg as well as his
walker. Physical Therapy inhouse worked with the patient , and it
was determined that the patient was unsafe to go home and it was
recommended that he go to a rehabilitation facility to which the
patient finally agreed.
