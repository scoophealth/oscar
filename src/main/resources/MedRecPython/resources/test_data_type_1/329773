HOSPITAL COURSE BY ORGAN SYSTEM:
1. Infectious Disease: In the emergency department , the
patient's left elbow was tapped by the orthopedic service. The
fluid was sent for Gram stain and culture , and showed 92 , 000
white blood cells with 95% polys , and no crystals. Gram stain
and culture remained negative throughout the patient's hospital
stay. The infectious disease service was consulted as well as
the patient's outpatient rheumatologist. Given the patient's
clinical history and the high white cell count found in the joint
fluid , it was decided that he would be started on cefotaxime and
vancomycin. On 6/17/2003 , despite cultures still being
negative , it was decided to manage the patient conservatively ,
and he was taken to the operating room , where the joint was
irrigated , and the fluid was sent as well as a biopsy of the
joint tissue. Pathology severe mixed acute and chronic synovitis
with foreign body giant cell reaction. The cultures sent from
the operating room remained negative until the time of discharge.
A nasal swab looking for MRSA was sent and came back negative.

be necessary as an outpatient , and the patient was discharged on
IV ceftriaxone q.24h. for 4 weeks. By the time of discharge , he
had been afebrile for greater than 48 hours.

infection. The patient was continued on NSAIDs for pain. The
rheumatology service followed the patient during his admission
throughout.

patient in the emergency department and interrogated his
pacemaker. They concluded that it was sensing correctly.
Following his joint washout , the patient did have an episode of
confusion , and his heart rate was found to be in the low 100s.
The EKG was difficult to interpret because of the patient's
pacer , and enzymes were sent , which later came back negative.
During his admission , a grade 2/6 systolic murmur was heard at
the right sternal border , thought to be a flow murmur , but it
should be worked up as an outpatient if it persists. The patient
was treated with metoprolol during his admission for his
