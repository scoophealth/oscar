HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 69 year-old woman
with a history of heart failure ,
preserved ejection fraction , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ,
obstructive sleep apnea , mild pulmonary hypertension who had an
increase in Torsemide dose from 100 mg b.i.d. to 180 mg b.i.d. She
also was subsequently started on Zaroxolyn two days prior to
admission. She has felt increasingly tired and light headed
without dyspnea. She has had a very dry mouth. She has also noted
a decline in urine output. She is admitted to the short stay unit
on March , 2000 when her BUN and creatinine were 125 and 4.2
respectively. This compared to a baseline creatinine of about 2.0.
She was admitted for intravenous hydration. She continues to
complain of dizziness when she sits up at the time of admission and
her creatinine has declined from 4.6 to 2.1 off all her medications
and with some mild hydration over the first two days of admission.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1 ) Diabetes mellitus. 2 ) Gastroesophageal
reflux disease. 3 ) Gout. 4 ) Congestive
heart failure secondary diastolic dysfunction. 5 ) Diverticulosis
in 1998. 6 ) Obstructive sleep apnea. 7 ) Hypertension. 8 )
Chronic renal insufficiency , baseline creatinine of about 2.0. 9 )
Anemia of chronic disease.
ALLERGIES: The patient is allergic to Morphine.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is married. She has five children and
two foster children. She quit smoking around nine
years ago. She uses a cane with walking.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Physical examination on admission was
significant for chest examination which was
clear. Cardiac examination was muffled , but you could hear an S4 ,
S1 and S2 with a jugular venous pressure around 7 cm , positive
hepatojugular reflux , 1+ peripheral edema of both legs.
Extremities were warm and well perfused. Abdomen is obese and
soft. There was no cyanosis or clubbing in the extremities.
LABORATORY: EKG showed a left ventricular hypertrophy , first
degree atrioventricular block with a heart rate around
90.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was initially admitted to the short
stay unit and was given fluid for two days and
all of her medications were held. She was admitted to the
Cardiology Service , however on May , 2000 , she had been inhouse
with that being her fourth day. Her cardiac medications were
progressively re-initiated and her Imdur was increased to 120 mg
p.o. b.i.d. Her course is notable for progressive decline in her
BUN and creatinine. On May , 2000 we restarted her Lisinopril at
10 mg b.i.d. She came in on 20 mg b.i.d. She did fine with this.
The next , however we restarted her Torsemide and increased her dose
of Lisinopril. This resulted in a bump of her BUN and creatinine
back up to around 2.8 from 1.9. Because she diuresed a total of
about 300 cc that day , we presumed this bump was due to increase
dose of Lisinopril. We decreased the dose back to 10 mg b.i.d. and
continued her Torsemide. The patient's BUN and creatinine
stabilized then at 63 and 2.8. Because of this response to
Lisinopril , we performed a renal artery scan with results pending
at the time of this dictation. The patient also at the time of
discharge clearly at her driest considering the medication regimen
that she is on. She is clearly orthostatic this morning. She will
be discharged on 100 mg p.o. Torsemide b.i.d. with before knowledge
that she will drink quite a bit more than she does inhouse. She
will be followed up for her potassium , renal function and renal
artery scan by Dr. Mel Minshall
