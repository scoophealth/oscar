to be non-icteric. There was no jugular venous distention. There
were no carotid bruits noted. Cardiovascular examination revealed
a regular rate and rhythm with no murmur , rub , or gallop noted.
The lungs were clear to auscultation without any evidence of
wheezes , rhonchi or rales. The abdomen revealed positive bowel
sounds and was soft , non-tender. It was difficult to assess for
any hepatosplenomegaly due to the patient's size. The extremities

noted. The pulses were 2+ throughout. Neurological examination
revealed the patient to be alert and oriented x 3 and the
examination was grossly non-focal.

saphenous vein graft to the RCA , and LIMA to the LAD. The total
cardiopulmonary bypass time was 155 minutes. The total cross-clamp
time was 108 minutes. The patient came off the heart lung machine
without any difficulties and on no drips. The patient was
extubated on postoperative day number one , March , 2001. The
patient remained in the Intensive Care Unit for respiratory reasons
and was there for three days. The patient required only diuresis
for improved oxygenation. On postoperative day number three , wires
and chest tubes were removed without any difficulty.
Postoperatively , it was noted on portable x-ray that the patient
had a small right pneumothorax status post chest tube removal.
Subsequent chest x-ray showed a decrease in pneumo size. The
patient had a PA model chest x-ray today that was pending and we
will decide on follow-up depending on the chest x-ray today. The
patient , otherwise , remained in normal sinus rhythm and was able to
be weaned off the O2 with diuresis. The patient was , otherwise ,
doing well with plans for discharge on postoperative day number
