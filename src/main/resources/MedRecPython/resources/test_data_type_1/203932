ATTENDING: FRANKLIN DIPPEL M.D.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 63-year-old female with type-2 diabetes and
hypertension and history of perihilar mass greater than 4 cm on
the CT scan from A Jaland Medical Center in July 2002 at which time she
refused biopsy. She now presents with nausea and vomiting. The
patient presents with two to three weeks of decrease p.o. intake
and diminished appetite in the past week. She has also had
nausea , vomiting , and epigastric pain after meals. Vomiting was
nonbloody and nonbilious. The patient has had a 10-pound weight
loss in the past two months. She also complains of myalgias ,
malaise , fatigue , dizziness , occasional shortness of breath ,
dyspnea on exertion , and a nonproductive cough. She denies chest
pain , palpitations , headaches , visual changes , or loss of
consciousness. She presented to her PCP on the day prior to
admission. Routine chemistries were checked and calcium was
found to be 14 , potassium 5.7 , and creatinine 4.6. She was
therefore sent to the Stter Hoodsress Mofoote Hospital Emergency Room. In the emergency
room she was afebrile , her heart rate was 56 , her blood pressure
was 147/70 , and she was saturating 98% on room air. Her EKG
showed bradycardia with no ST changes and no big T waves.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Type-2 diabetes , hypertension , perihilar lung mass greater than 4
cm on CT from July 2002 at Alpe Health Care at which time the
patient refused biopsy.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Temperature 98.4 , heart rate 56 , blood pressure 147/70 , and
saturation 98% on room air. No cervical lymphadenopathy. No
neck masses. No thyromegaly. Chest with bilateral crackles
2/3rd of the way up , which are per PCP are chronic.
Cardiovascular , distant heart sounds , S1 , S2. No rubs , murmurs ,
or gallops. JVP flat. No carotid bruits. Abdomen , soft and
nondistended. Epigastrium is tender to palpation. No masses.
No inguinal lymphadenopathy. No peripheral edema , clubbing , or
cyanosis.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Hypercalcemia. The patient's initial calcium was 13.2 , a
decrease to the mid 9 range with aggressive IV fluids. Studies
sent included PTH = 26 , vitamin D = 27 , TSH = 1.69 , and PTHrP
which is still pending at the time of discharge. The patient had
a negative PPD placed three induced sputum for TB , which were all
negative. SPEP and UPEP had increased gamma globulins , but he
was polyclonal and no end spikes. A chest CT showed large
mediastinal lymphadenopathy with multiple 2-3 cm nodes. No
intraparenchymal disease. A mediastinoscopy for biopsy and
intraoperative BAL were done and the pathology and microbiology
are pending at the time of discharge. Abdominal CT was negative.
2. Renal. Baseline creatinine is 2-3. Creatinine increased to
6 on admission and was down to 3.4 with aggressive hydration by
the time of discharge. There were no casts in her urine. Her
phenol was 11.6% on admission. It was thought that her acute
renal failure was secondary to prerenal azotemia as well as a
component of ATN and tubular damage from the hypercalcemia. Her
creatinine remains stable around 3.4 on discharge.
3. Pulmonary. She did not have any pulmonary symptoms except
for a mild cough that had resolved on admission. She did have
persistent bibasilar crackles , which were old per her PCP. She
had no shortness of breath and her saturations remain greater
than 96% on room air throughout admission. Her chest x-ray
showed no evidence of infiltrates , but did show right mediastinal
widening and calcific nodularity in the right upper lobes. Chest
CT showed mediastinal lymphadenopathy as described above and also
a small area of tree-in-bud inflammation. She was ruled out for
TB with induced sputum x 3. Mediastinoscopy biopsy on 11/17/04 ,
results are pending.
4. Heme. Anemia workup. Iron 49 , TIBC 256 , B12 555 , folate
normal , ferritin 102 , reticulocyte 7.9 , and Epogen level 19. She
has a normocytic anemia , but given her chronic renal
insufficiency she has a mild degree of iron deficiency. The
likely etiology of her anemia is secondary to renal disease.
Iron supplementation was started. Hematocrit was stable
throughout admission.
5. Endocrine. The patient has a history of diabetes and was
hypoglycemic on admission. This resolved with hydration. Her
PTH was 26 , her vitamin D was 27 , PTHrP is pending. She was kept
on a regular insulin sliding scale during the admission. She
resumed her NPH dose as an outpatient on discharge. She will
need a close follow up of blood sugars as an outpatient. Her TSH
was 1.69.
6. Skin. The patient had a pruritic rash on her right back ,
which appeared about a week prior to admission. She had a few
scattered 1-2 cm dark nodular regions over the mid right back.
She did not have pustules or discharge from lesions. She also
had areas of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation on her left upper
back.
DISPOSITION.
The patient is discharged home in stable condition. She will
follow up in one week with her PCP Dr. Gensel He will need to
discontinue the stitches on her neck and follow up all the
results and arrange treatment as appropriate. Instructions were
given to the patient in Spanish.

Cardizem SR 240 mg p.o. q.d. , metoprolol XL 75 mg q.d. , NPH at
home doses , iron 325 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Percocet one tablet p.o.
q.6h. p.r.n. pain for the few days following the mediastinoscopy.
