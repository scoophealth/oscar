Initially , Lopressor 25 mg q.i.d. which was converted to once a day
atenolol. The patient remained chest pain free throughout his
hospital course and developed no evidence of arrhythmia while on
the cardiac monitor. Since the patient had slightly high blood
pressures with systolics in the 160-170 range , he was started on
lisinopril 10 mg q.day for his hypertension in a diabetic patient.

diabetes remained under good control while in the hospital. Also
during the hospital stay , the patient had an echocardiogram which
showed the following results: Ejection fraction was 53% with a low
normal systolic function and some posterior basal akinesis with
inferior hypokinesis and lateral hypokinesis. The plan for the
patient will be to follow up with Dr. Theo Sear and to undergo
and full ETT six weeks after his MI. Dr. Sopha will also check
the patient's lipid profile and start him on anticholesterol
medications as indicated.
